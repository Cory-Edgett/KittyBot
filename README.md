# KittyBot
#### Description
This is a "pet" project of mine to practice and apply various frameworks and technologies (spring, javafx, deeplearning4j, etc).

The application itself is a discord bot that gives you random cat pictures :)
#### Setup
In Config.properties: 
  1. Set token to your bot's token found at https://discordapp.com/developers/applications. If you have not set up a bot account, do so there.
  2. Set Owner.id to your member id (After enabling developer mode, user id can be copied by right-clicking a user in chat and selecting "copy id" at the bottom of the list).

#### Dependencies
[Java Discord API](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA)

[Spring Framework](https://spring.io/)

[The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/)
